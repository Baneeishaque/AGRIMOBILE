\abstract{  \OnePageChapter	% one page only ??
	‘PC Control’ is a mobile application software for parents to monitor and control their child PC remotely. It enables one to monitor the remote machines desktop and thus control it with their android touch pointer. It can be used with Microsoft Windows to perform real time remote system control and administration tasks through different network environments. This application software requires a TCP/IP connection between the server and the client, which works  either in LAN's or in WAN's; even on internet if one provides a IP address for their machine. When the connection between a client and a server is first established, the server begins by requesting authentication from the client using an authentication, which typically results in the user being prompted for a user name and password at the client end. It does, however, provide the primary user of a PC with remote access to their desktop. There will be an option to send messages to the server machine; these messages will be notified on the server screen. In addition to the control through desktop; there will be short cuts (i.e. single click actions) for power options.}
