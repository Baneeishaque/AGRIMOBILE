\section{\label{desigpha}System Architecture}



It is worth mentioning that the work encompasses multiple areas such Semantic Web, Text Data mining, Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Recovery in Text and Knowledge Representation, Computational linguistics and Artificial Intelligence. Many of these areas are active topics of research in different universities all over the world.
Hence majority of the existing papers in related topics, make use of the previous work for the ``interim" results, as a way to achieve their final result \cite{PFEMRJJ04}\cite{RG01}\cite{IKM04}.


Also considering the complexity involved in the unpredictable nature of unstructured text, only a semi automatic system could be visualised and implemented. 


The proposed system will have the following stages:-

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Stage I} Extraction of the information semantically with the help of vocabularies.
\item \emph{Stage II} Validation of concepts that are identified from Stage I.
\item \emph{Stage III} Integration of concepts by sorting out the similarities and conflicts identified in Stage II.
\item \emph{Stage IV} Conversion to Semantic Web Format - in conformity to the IPTC standards.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{\label{phastg1}Extraction of the information semantically with the help of vocabularies.}

In this stage, unstructured text is throughly mined to get patterns as per the previously specified vocabulary. The portions of the text identified will be annotated for later use. The output of this stage will be a  set of Concepts that can be semantically correct - whose validity has to be verified in the next stage.
Vocabularies were created in conformity with the SportsML specifications announced by IPTC. Several schemas are developed by IPTC for each sports item such as Football, Tennis etc. Only a subset of these schemas were considered to create the vocabularies for our work. 


\subsection{\label{phastg2}Validation of concepts that are identified from Stage I.}

In this stage, the concepts identified in stage I will be compared against the semantic correctness envisaged in the vocabulary. This stage is a self learning mechanism, and hence will be semi automatic. It reveals the similarities and conflicts in the concepts that are already identified.

 
\subsection{\label{phastg3}Integration of concepts with results identified in Stage II.}

Stage III takes care of resolving the similarities and conflicts identified in the concepts extracted. In case of similarities, the concepts will have to be merged; in case of conflicts, it can be due to different semantics, multiple concepts or different relations.  

\subsection{\label{phastg4}Conversion to Semantic Web Format - in conformity to the IPTC standards.}

In the final stage, the correctly identified concepts are codified as per RDF, the model for Semantic Web. Since the domain of the text being converted is sports news, even the converted information will be kept in conformity to the IPTC standards.
