\subsection{Introduction to Eclipse}
\label{Introduction to Eclipse}
	Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE). It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. Eclipse can be used to develop applications in Java. By means of various plug-ins, Eclipse may also be used to develop applications in other programming languages: Ada, C, C++, COBOL, FORTRAN, Haskell, JavaScript, Lasso, Perl, PHP, Python, R, Ruby (including Ruby on Rails framework), Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Scheme, and Erlang. Development environments include the Eclipse Java development tools (JDT) for Java and Scala, Eclipse CDT for C/C++ and Eclipse PDT for PHP, among others.

\subsection{Introduction to TightVNC}
\label{Introduction to TightVNC}
	TightVNC is a free remote control software package. It can be used to perform remote control and administration tasks in Windows, Unix and mixed network environments. It also helpful in distance learning and remote customer support. Finally, one can find a number of additional VNC-compatible utilities and packages that can extend the areas where TightVNC can be helpful. 
	
\subsection{Introduction to Microsoft Visual Studio }
\label{Introduction to Microsoft Visual Studio}
	Visual Studio is a complete set of development tools for building ASP.NET Web applications, XML Web Services, desktop applications, and mobile applications. Visual Basic, Visual C#, and Visual C++ all use the same integrated development environment (IDE), which enables tool sharing and eases the creation of mixed-language solutions. In addition, these languages use the functionality of the .NET Framework, which provides access to key technologies that simplify the development of ASP Web applications and XML Web Services.
