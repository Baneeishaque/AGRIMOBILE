\abstract{  \OnePageChapter	% one page only ??
	 Analysis done on the nature of the data posted on the Net reveal that more than 80\% of the data over the Net is in unstructured text format. Hence extracting information from text is of paramount importance both for academic and business purposes. Simultaneously, evolution of web technology led to the novel concept of Semantic Web,  which is an extension of the current web in which information is given well-defined meaning, enabling computers and people to work in cooperation in a better way. Integration of voluminous, legacy text data that are unstructured and semistructured, into Semantic Web format is a challenging and daunting task for the research community. This thesis work is an attempt to marry the concept of Semantic Web format with unstructured text, thus to enable the computers, the discovery of new, previously unknown information, by automatically extracting information from different written resources. A key element is the linking together of the extracted information semantically together so that it can be directly used by the Semantic Web projects. The design of the proposed system is found to be complex, due to the primary fact that the work encompasses several research areas and these results are still in evolving stage.}
